Note: 
This version is preserved as significant methodological differences exist between dated Trinity versions (ex. date.2011_11_26) and Trinity versions >2, and the older versions may perform better in some applications (ex. viral RNAseq).
The recipe for this dated version is preserved so it will continue to be built.
